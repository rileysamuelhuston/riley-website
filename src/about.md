<strong>Hello. I’m Riley.</strong><br />
I’m an industrial design student at the University of
Washington. I enjoy playing trumpet, video games, as
well as cooking things. I also like baking. Sometimes
I’ll visit home where I get to see my dog. I’ve also
started sorting my LEGO collection... I’ll let you know
how that goes.
