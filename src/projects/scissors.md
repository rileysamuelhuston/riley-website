This was the first project in the class DESIGN 316: Introduction to Industrial design. We were given one week to reasearch scissors and come up with
__a)__ a market to design for, __b)__ competitors in that market, __c)__ possible features for the given niche, and __d)__ a design concept. Then we were shown the woodshop and given high-density foam with which to prototype. And prototype we did! I had a blast.
