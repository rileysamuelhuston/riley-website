<p class="right-justify">This assignment was an exercise in quickly rendering sketches into more actionable images and ideas.<br><br>
I used a combination of pen and paper sketches and digital tools to show the different contours and components of the drills.</p>

<strong> The Design Process </strong>
<br>
<br>

**I started by** sketching a few different products... Speakers, furniture, glue guns. I liked drills because I have experience using them and had good ideas.<br><br>
**It was difficult to** decide on the different materials that should make up the drillâ€™s body. Thinking about use and the final customer helped me decide.<br><br>
**My next steps would be** to continue practicing these skills as I get better at ideation,
sketching, and rendering.<br><br>
