This was the final project for Design 166, the entrance class into the design program at UW. It prompted us to create a package design for 3-4 bottled drinks. I landed on this inverted "V" shape after a few different iterations. With this shape I created a package and a display case in one. The process wasn't very long but I learned a lot about ergonomics and cosumer patterns.
