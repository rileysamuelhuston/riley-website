This was the final project in DESIGN 322: Presentation for Industrial Design. We were given the opportunity to model any product we wanted. I chose something related to the kitchen since I enjoy cooking and baking.

<strong>Good bread requires steam. </strong>
<br>
<br>
Professional bakers use $10,000 steam-injection ovens to bake perfect loaves all day long. There are home alternatives to this, but the options available range from $500 to $1,200 and offer limited capacity because of their counter-top form factor.

During my research I found that most home bakers use a dutch oven. This works fine. Dutch ovens capture the steam produced by the loaf itself during the baking process, which contributes to oven spring. The problems begin from the moment the oven begins to preheat to 500°F. The baker must carefully place the bread  into the dutch oven.

Parchment paper is often used as a sling for the bread dough, which works to avoid burning, but disintegrates after sitting in the oven. Some home bakers resort to silicone mats, but this is a stopgap rather than a good, all-round solution.

An alternative to the using dutch oven’s steam effect is putting pans into the oven. Not many pans are both large, oven-safe, and easy to handle, which means that frypans and skillets are the go-to for many home bakers. Again, this works, but requires the baker to manuver around a home kitchen with boiling water, which is a very dangerous task! Spilling water can burn skin or break oven glass from the temperature shock.

<strong>Sketching & ideating.</strong>  

I had to balance the function of the pan with a modern kitchen aesthetic. I ended up with a round and welcoming shape that would mimic the form of a boule-style bread loaf.

<h1>Introducing the Bool. A bread steamer for the home baker.</h1>

<strong>Function & Use</strong>

The pan&rsquo;s operation is simple. Twist the top cover to change the amount of steam that the pan releases. There are two chambers: one filled with just water, and one filled with water-absorbent porcelean cubes. These blocks hold on to water and release it more slowly as steam, increasing the time it takes to fully deplete the water.

<strong>Components & Construction</strong>
(From top to bottom) Rotating top cover, secondary top cover, porcelean cubes, ceramic body, dual reservoir, large handles.

<strong>Size & Shape</strong>

The Bool measures 8 inches in diameter (not including the handles). This is the same size as an average boule-shaped loaf, making it the perfect size for any oven.

<strong>Conclusion & Next Steps</strong>

Overall this was a fun project. The modeling component was not technically very difficult. Instead, I struggled with the ideation and form, which took the longest. If I had time, I would have created 3D models of the shape to do ergonomic and coreographic studies before landing on a final shape. I definitely want to revisit this product and create a functional prototype.
