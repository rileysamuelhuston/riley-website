	<p><strong>Though functional, self-checkout machines do not provide a streamlined experience for shoppers.</strong>
<br><br>
Checkout machines are most efficient when a customer only wants to buy a few items and doesn’t want to contend with the lines of a normal cashier. The reality, though, is that these machines are neither friendly nor compelling and instead make the checkout experience less desirable. Today these machines lack certain affordances and design considerations, which makes them difficult to use for experienced and new customers alike.
<br><br>
This was a project for one of the introductory courses in the industrial design program my sophomore year.
<br> <br>
<br><br>
<strong>Lack of Affordances</strong>
<br><br>
While experienced users will know how to use the machine, new users would find it hard to tell where to start. Approaching the machine users are greeted with a “recording in progress” monitor, a screen with “open,” and three grey shelves all at different heights. Some machines use a bright yellow label to clarify the bagging vs scanning areas. It’s also easy to miss the receipt when it prints, so machines are left with a customer’s receipt still on the roll.</p>
